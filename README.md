# Engineering Delivery Blueprint (EDB)

The **Engineering Delivery Blueprint (EDB)** is a professional, structured development blueprint designed for disciplined, AI-assisted engineering.

EDB combines:

- A **BMAD-powered delivery operating model** (Break → Model → Analyze → Deliver)
- A **CODEX-driven structured workflow entry point**
- A formal **Engineering Governance Baseline**
  - Versioning
  - Release discipline
  - Security scope
  - Testing scope
  - Performance governance
  - Observability scope
  - Branch & PR workflow
  - ADR decision documentation

EDB is built to support professional-grade development processes and to prevent unstructured or “vibe-coding” approaches.
