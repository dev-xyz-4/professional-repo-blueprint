## Phase 1 — Engineering Layer Structurally Complete

As of v1.12.18, the Engineering Layer of this repository is declared **Phase 1 Complete**.

Repository identity reference:
- `docs/_edb-development-history/ADR-0001-identity.md`

This declaration confirms that:

- All declared engineering governance dimensions are documented.
- Scope guides are structurally aligned.
- Owner-boundary references are present for workflow, versioning, and classification.
- Governance terminology and section framing are synchronized to the current baseline.

## Included Governance Dimensions

The Phase-1 Engineering Governance Baseline includes:

- `docs/engineering/versioning.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/VERSIONING_GUIDE.md` (informational)
- `docs/engineering/guides/RELEASE_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/BRANCH_WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/SECURITY_SCOPE_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/TESTING_SCOPE_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/OBSERVABILITY_SCOPE_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/PROJECT_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`
- `docs/engineering/guides/PR_HELPER_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/entry/ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md`

All above components are versioned repository artifacts.

## What Phase 1 Means

Phase 1 Complete means:

- The Engineering Layer is structurally coherent.
- Governance dimensions are baseline-defined.
- No declared governance dimension is structurally missing.
- Expansion is treated as an explicit follow-up activity.

Phase 1 does NOT mean:

- The governance model is final.
- No additional guides may be introduced.
- No future refinements are expected.

Future changes are tracked through versioned documentation updates.

## Governance Stability Commitment

From v1.12.18 onward, this baseline is maintained as an operational snapshot.
Normative behavior ownership remains defined in:

- `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` (workflow)
- `docs/engineering/versioning.md` (versioning)
- `docs/engineering/guides/PROJECT_CLASSIFICATION.md` (classification)

## Version

Initial baseline declaration established at v1.11.7.  
Current synchronized baseline: v1.12.19.
