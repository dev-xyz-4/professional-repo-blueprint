# ADR Template

Use this template to document architecture decisions in a traceable, reviewable, and reusable format.

This template supports governance baseline consolidation leading to `v1.9.0`.

  - ADR IDs MUST be sequential and immutable once assigned.
- Title: `<short-decision-title>`
- Date: `<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- Status: `<Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected>`
  - If superseded, reference the ADR ID that replaces it.
- Owners/Authors (optional): `<name(s)>`

## Validation / How To Verify

Define how to confirm the decision is working as intended.

Guidance:
- What signals, tests, or metrics indicate success?
- What checkpoints will be used post-implementation?

Validation checklist (example):
