# CHAT_HANDOVER_PROTOCOL TEMPLATE

Canonical backup template (non-authoritative).
Not routing authority, not policy authority.
For day-to-day usage, prefer the entry-surface document at `docs/entry/chat-handover-protocol.md`.

## Purpose

This document is a state snapshot for continuity between chat sessions.
It should contain current project context, not policy definitions.
Mode-specific live write targets are defined in `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_ENTRY.md` and should not be restated here.

For authoritative routing and governance behavior, use:
- `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_ENTRY.md`
- `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`
- `docs/entry/ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md`

# 1. Repository Purpose

This repository is an **<repository-identity>**.

It separates three structural layers:

1) docs/00-project  
   → Project identity (scope, risk profile, architecture overview, glossary)

2) docs/bmad  
   → BMAD-powered delivery operating model (Break → Model → Analyze → Deliver)  
   → Minor vs Feature classification  
   → Commit conventions  
   → CODEX workflow enforcement

3) docs/engineering  
   → Engineering governance  
   → Security  
   → Testing  
   → Versioning  
   → Release discipline  
   → Templates & Guides

Additionally:
- scripts/quality → quality automation layer
