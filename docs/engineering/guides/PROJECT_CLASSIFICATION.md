# PROJECT CLASSIFICATION GUIDE

Generated on: 2026-02-15

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

Define the canonical project-type taxonomy used across all Engineering Layer scope guides.

This document:
- Standardizes terminology.
- Prevents taxonomy drift.
- Ensures structural consistency across governance documents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Canonical Project Types

The Engineering Layer recognizes the following project types:

1. Local Tool (private use)
   - Definition: Non-distributed tool used by a single individual.

2. Internal Tool (team use)
   - Definition: Tool used by a defined internal group without public exposure.

3. Desktop Application (distributed binary)
   - Definition: Packaged client software distributed to users.

4. Public Web Application
   - Definition: Browser-based application exposed publicly.

5. API / SDK
   - Definition: Programmatic interface consumed by external or internal systems.

6. Web3 / Financial-Sensitive Application
   - Definition: System interacting with blockchain, financial transactions, or regulatory-sensitive domains.

## Legacy Term Mapping

| Legacy Term | Canonical Term |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Desktop App" | Desktop Application |
| "Web3 App" | Web3 / Financial-Sensitive Application |
| "Financial-Critical App" | Web3 / Financial-Sensitive Application |
| "Public Web App" | Public Web Application |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Governance Rule

All Engineering Layer scope guides MUST use the canonical project-type terminology defined in this document.

Deviation from this taxonomy is not permitted without a documented governance change.
