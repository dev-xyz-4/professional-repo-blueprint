## Phase 1 — Engineering Layer Structurally Complete

As of v1.11.7, the Engineering Layer of this repository is declared **Phase 1 Complete**.

Repository identity reference:
- `docs/_edb-development-history/ADR-0001-identity.md`

This declaration confirms that:

- All declared governance dimensions are formally defined.
- Scope guides are structurally consistent.
- Normative models are explicitly defined and interoperable.
- Governance boundaries are harmonized.
- Terminology is standardized.
- No structural gaps remain in declared baseline scope.

---

## Included Governance Dimensions

The Phase-1 Engineering Governance Baseline includes:

- VERSIONING_GUIDE
- RELEASE_GUIDE
- SECURITY_SCOPE_GUIDE
- TESTING_SCOPE_GUIDE
- PERFORMANCE_GUIDE
- OBSERVABILITY_SCOPE_GUIDE
- PROJECT_CLASSIFICATION
- GOVERNANCE_MODEL
- BRANCH_WORKFLOW
- PR_HELPER_GUIDE
- ADR template
- ORCHESTRATION_INDEX (canonical startup map)

All above components are formally versioned and aligned.

## What Phase 1 Means

Phase 1 Complete means:

- The Engineering Layer is structurally coherent.
- Governance dimensions are baseline-defined.
- No declared governance dimension is structurally missing.
- Expansion is now intentional, not gap-driven.

Phase 1 does NOT mean:

- The governance model is final.
- No additional guides may be introduced.
- No future refinements are expected.

Future changes are considered controlled expansions or refinements.

## Governance Stability Commitment

From v1.11.7 onward:

- New governance guides require explicit justification.
- Normative model changes require deliberate version classification.
- Structural drift is not permitted without documented rationale.

---

## Phase 2

Phase 2B note:
- At v1.12.0, orchestration clarity was strengthened with a canonical startup map and ADR-backed authority boundary documentation.

---

## Version

Initial baseline declaration established at v1.11.7.
