# BMAD LLM Briefing Template

Canonical template scaffold (non-authoritative).
Not routing authority, not policy authority.
For day-to-day usage, prefer the entry-surface document at `docs/entry/LLM-bmad-briefing.md`.

## Purpose and Scope

Use this briefing to start a new chat session with concise project context.
It is interaction-focused and should remain lightweight.
Mode-specific live write targets are defined in `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_ENTRY.md` and should not be restated here.

For authoritative routing and governance behavior, use:
- `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_ENTRY.md`
- `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`
- `docs/entry/ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/entry/chat-handover-protocol.md`
