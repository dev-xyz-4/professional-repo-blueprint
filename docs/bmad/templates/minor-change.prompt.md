# Prompt-Template: Minor Change (Implementation)

Prompt scaffold (non-authoritative).
Not routing authority, not policy authority.
For day-to-day startup context, prefer `docs/entry/LLM-bmad-briefing.md`.

```text
Read docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_ENTRY.md.
Follow the routing and rules defined there (including the referenced policy).
Switch to Implementation Mode.

This task is a Minor Change.

Fix:
- <short-minor-change-title>

Problem:

- <problem-point-2>

SemVer Decision (capture):
- SemVer Decision: `<SemVer PATCH | SemVer MINOR | SemVer MAJOR | no SemVer change>`
- Rationale:
  - `<rationale-point-1>`
  - `<rationale-point-2>`
- Planned tag: `<vX.Y.Z | N/A>`

Expected behavior:
- When <condition>:
