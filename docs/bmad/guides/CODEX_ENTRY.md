# CODEX Entry

This document is the **single entry point** for using Codex in this repository.
All Codex-assisted work must start here.

---

## Mandatory Reading Order

Codex must read these documents before starting any task.
The authoritative rules for Codex behavior are defined in
`docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`.

Reading order:

1. `docs/bmad/README.md`
2. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_DECISION_MATRIX.md`
3. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_SETUP_Lean_Integration.md`
4. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md`
5. `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`

These documents define the process, classification, and commit discipline.

---

## What To Do Next

After reading the documents above:

- Classify the task via `BMAD_DECISION_MATRIX.md`.
- Follow `CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` for process behavior.
- Follow `BMAD_COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md` for commit format and review expectations.

If classified as BMAD Feature:
- Work in `docs/bmad/features/<feature-name>/`.

If classified as Minor Change:
- Update `docs/bmad/notes/minor-changes.md`.

## Final Rule

> ENTRY routes to the governing documents.  
> Codex behavior rules live exclusively in  
> `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`.
>  
> The Decision Matrix provides classification only.
