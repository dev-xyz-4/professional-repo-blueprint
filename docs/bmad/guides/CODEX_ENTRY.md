# CODEX Entry

This document is the routing entry point for using Codex in this repository.
It provides startup sequence and owner-document links.

---

## Recommended Reading Order

For authoritative Codex behavior rules, refer to
`docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`.

Reading order:

1. `docs/bmad/README.md`
2. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_DECISION_MATRIX.md`
3. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_SETUP_Lean_Integration.md`
4. `docs/bmad/guides/BMAD_COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md`
5. `docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`

This sequence provides operational context.
Binding process behavior is owned by
`docs/bmad/guides/CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md`.

---

## What To Do Next

After reading the documents above:

- Classify the task via `BMAD_DECISION_MATRIX.md`.
- Follow `CODEX_WORKFLOW_POLICY.md` for process behavior.
- Follow `BMAD_COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md` for commit format and review expectations.
- Use `docs/entry/ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md` as the canonical startup map for authority boundaries and mode-aware context (non-normative helper).

If classified as BMAD Feature:
- Work in `docs/bmad/features/<feature-name>/`.

If classified as Minor Change:
- Route log updates via the active mode target (see Mode-Aware Routing below and owner policy).


---

## Mode-Aware Routing

There are two operating modes:
Routing targets depend on the active mode (Project Mode by default).
Project Mode is the default behavior and requires no additional configuration.

### Project Mode (default)
Used by downstream projects.

Use these canonical targets:
- `docs/bmad/notes/minor-change-log.md`
- `docs/entry/chat-handover-protocol.md`
- `docs/engineering/engineering-baseline.md`

### EDB Mode (blueprint development only)
Activated when .planning/EDB_MODE exists locally (gitignored) or EDB_MODE=1 is set.

Use these canonical targets:
- `docs/_edb-development-history/EDB_MINOR_CHANGE_LOG.md`
- `docs/_edb-development-history/EDB_CHAT_HANDOVER_PROTOCOL.md`
- `docs/_edb-development-history/EDB_ENGINEERING_BASELINE.md`

If no mode indicator is present, Project Mode applies.

Guides and prompts route to downstream live documents.
`docs/_edb-development-history/` is blueprint-only self-history.
`docs/entry/ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md` is a contextual orchestration map and does not replace policy authority.

Versioning and SemVer ownership route to:
- `docs/engineering/versioning.md`

Namespace reminder:
- Workflow classification: `Minor Change (workflow)` / `BMAD Feature`
- Version classification: `SemVer PATCH` / `SemVer MINOR` / `SemVer MAJOR`
